# AWS Concepts

* Resources
* On Demand Resources 
  * Start up and shut down as needed
  * Pay only for what you use
* Automation
  * Automate manual tasks
  * Scale up and down as needed based on demand (automatically)
* Security
  * Policies and permissions
  * Encryption
  * Compliance
* Managed Services
  * Managed Storage: S3 (automated backups)
  * Managed compute: EC2 (automated scaling and restarts)
  * Managed DB: RDS, No SQL (automated backups and scaling)
  * Managed Load Balancer: ELB (automated scaling and failover)
