# Assignments

Create a repository on GitHub for your hands-on assignments. For each hands-on assignment, create a folder in your repository and add a README.md to the folder. Then link the README.md to the main README.md in your repository in a table of contents.

For each hands-on assignment, take screenshots of you working on the assignment and add them to the README.md. This will document the process and help you remember what you did and how you did it.


Sample README.md for an assignment:

```markdown
